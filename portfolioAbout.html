        <li>I first started coding around 2nd grade. I learned scratch (block coding software) with my school. I enjoyed it a lot, and took part in different electives to further my knowledge. </li>
        <li>At some point, around 6-7th grade, I essentially mastered scratch, with <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/284277485/" target="_blank">platformer games</a> and other projects. I wanted to expand my coding knowledge, so I started taking lessons in python. 
        </li>
        <li>
          At first, my main focus was videogame design. I spent most of my scratch time making them, so they were what I coded first in python. After learning the basics, I created games like Blackjack, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Hangman, where you play them in the terminal. 
        </li>
        <li>
          After some terminal games, I got into some basic software coding. My most memorable project was a spell checker, that would take paragraphs and correct any misspelled words by adding, removing, and replacing letters.  
        </li>
        <li>
          More recently, I started learning pgzero and pygame to create better games in python. I created a lot of minigames, each one focusing on a different aspect of pygame, and summed it all up with my Tower Defense game. 
        </li>
        <li>
          I also expiremented with a Rasberry Pi a bit this year, creating a reminder system that would send me emails. 
        </li>
        <li>
          For this summer, I plan to spend more time learning Unity. While 2D games in python are fun, I want to step it up with some unity, so by the time I start computer science at Riverdale, I should have my skills refined, and a strong knowledge of unity to start of 9th grade.
