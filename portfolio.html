      <!-- First project description -->
      <p style="font-size: 16pt">This was my final pgzero game, a way to sum up everything I knew. I took inspiration from games like bloons, and spent around 3 weeks creating this. It involves 3 towers and enemies, and is probably my most complicated game and longest. It displays usage of classes, functions, dictionaries, loops, conditionals, as well as many other topics. It took a lot of coding knowledge, as well as the actual planning and logic portion of it. The majority of art was done by me, but I used some images online for the enemies. </p>

    <div class="col-sm-3"> 
      <!-- Second project description -->
      <p style="font-size: 16pt">To express my knowledge in HTML and Java script I created this portfolio. I used a basic template for the framework, but the majority of the work is mine. While HTML and Javascript aren't a focus of mine, I know they are relevant and important in formatting and app/website creation, so I spent about 2 months learning about it and created this. It includes 3 pages, an entry page including an entry code, a home page (here) containing my projects, and an about page containing my coding expierence and plans for the future. </p>

    <div class="col-sm-3"> 
      <!-- Third project description -->
      <p style="font-size: 16pt">Ask the Expert is a basic project I created earlier this year. I decided to show it because it shows a different interface I am familier with, TKinter. Ask the Expert is a basic database that has countries and their capitals. Users can also input countries and their capitals if they aren't already in the database. </p>

      <!-- Fourth project description -->
      <p style="font-size: 16pt">I started coding in Unity recently, and found it a lot of fun. I don't have a specific project to show, as I am just getting started by following a unity course. I plan to focus on unity for the entire summer, so I should be pretty refined by the start of 9th grade. I started using Unity because I enjoy creating videogames in python but the 2D software has restrictions, while Unity is essentially endless. Along with it I plan to start using blender, which I already have started to experiment with.</p>
